# The current stage of you development
# Usally dev, staging or prod
stage: dev
# Name the service you are developing
service: test-service

# Here you can declare the wanted resource
resources:
  #myStorage: cloud-drive
  #myDatabase: cloud-db

# Here you can declare varibles you may use
# in the functions
varibles:
  #myVarible: hello world
  #myVarible2: Thanks for using 10x project
  #x:5
  #y:6

# Here you declare which file you which to
# include from to be used in the functions
include:
  # myLogModule: log
  # addModule: add

# Here you can declare yml templates to be
# used in you code. You can download default
# templates or create your own
templates:
  # myTemplate: helloworld

# After here all the declarations are functions
# see example. Rember to set the return value to
# ensure a response is sent to the client. Its also
# a good pratices to set the input to a template
# for automatic module testing.
exampleFunction:
  ##> This makes the program undertand that
  ##> this function only take the template
  ##> myTemplate. This make a safe way of
  ##> ensuring the user follows your rules.
  # input: myTemplate
  #
  ##> This saves the return value of the
  ##> add function in the varible called
  ##> sum. To be used later in the function
  # sum: add(x,y)
  #
  ##> Writing void on the left side.
  ##> make the return value of the funtion
  ##> not saved. Like an void in regular
  ##> programming. This can be used when
  ##> loggin or updating databases.
  # void: log(sum)
  #
  ##> This send back the value stored in
  ##> the return varible
  # return: myVarible
